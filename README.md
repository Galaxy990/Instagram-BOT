# Instagram-BOT

This is an Automated Web Crawler project which is used to dynamically scrape Instagram to gather information about :-

1) Instagram Handles
2) No. Of Followers, Post done in the past few days, Hashtags used by bloggers and many more other crucial information.
3) It can automatically like/Unlike a Post, Handle.
4) All the information gathered are stored in a CSV File which can be further preprocessed and filtered for Data Analysis purposes to gain valuable insights and patterns. It can also be used to draw out behavioural patterns of Bloggers ex:- No. Of Posts made in a day, Popular Hashtags used bu them etc.

# HOW TO USE :-

1) To log in to Instagram we just need to provide the EMAIL ID and the PASSWORD, and the automated test software will log us into instagram
2) We can provide any topic in the SEARCH BAR and we will get the top 10 Handles from where we can get the top 5 handles with Highest number of followers. Here in the project I have searched for Handles related to 'food'.
3) We can also get the number of Posts done by these Handles in the Last 3 Days (NOTE :- We can increase the range of the Days, in this example it is 3).
4) We can get the Most Frequent words used by Bloggers in the Posts, it is very useful in Natural Language Processing to identify the type of Person through His/Her Words.
5) We can get the name of the Followers of a Specific Handle, this functionality can be used to identify whether a particular person is present in someones followers list or not.
